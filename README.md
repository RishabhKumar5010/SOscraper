# SOscrapper
Extracts data from Stack Overflow questions and answers based on a given url


### Execution:

`python3 SOscraper.py`

### Inspiration

This is actually a sub-module of one of my other personal projects.\
It could be helpful as a starting point for someone who wants to scrape from stackoverflow. I think this module scrapes almost everything that maybe necessary from a QnA website. (except comments ,tags and time of post).
